        At <?= Yii::$app->name; ?> we know how much going to see an artist costs, so
        we want you to get your experience at full value! You will be asked to select two
        artists or two venues, we will complete some calculations and then inform you what
        we think based off of our data.
        <br><br>
        Let's get started, would you like to compare artists or venues?
